# Challenge-5-Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple workday scheduling application.

- Created for bootcamp challenge 5
- This application can help you plan your workday.
- Through writing the javascript for this application, I learned to use JQuery and dayJS.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to make full use of this application, there are a few things to notice:

- First, each timeblock is color coded. A gray timeblock means that that hour has passed. Red means that that timeblock is the current hour. Green means that that timeblock is in the future.
- Second, you can click inside each color-coded timeblock. This will allow you to type in plans, reminders, or anything else you might want written down for that part of the day.
- Third, to save the information you've typed, click on the blue save button to the right of each timeblock. These save buttons will only save the information in their corresponding timeblocks.
